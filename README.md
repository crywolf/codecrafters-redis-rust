# Simplified Redis

This is a starting point for Rust solutions to the
["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).

In this challenge, you'll build a Redis clone that's capable of handling
basic commands like `PING`, `ECHO`, `SET` and `GET`. Along the way we'll learn about
event loops, the Redis protocol, replicas and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.
